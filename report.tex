\section*{Abstract}
Scala is a powerful language which currently provides a built-in library for lazy views with some important shortcomings for the users such as unexpected and unintuitive behaviors.
In this work we created a new library, based on Scala Blitz, to provide lightweight, lazy and parallel-efficient views from the start.

\section{Introduction}
% subject of the work
% scala (powerful, fast-moving lang
% standard collections, lazy and views
Scala is a powerful and fast-moving language that fuses object-oriented programming with a wide range of function programming concepts \cite{scala-overview}.
It runs on the JVM and as such it stays compatible with Java and its ecosystem.
Scala itself provides an important number of libraries, for example Scala collection, which implements Lists, Arrays, Maps and Sets with immutable and mutable variants.
They are more in accord within the Scala environment than the Java collections, moreover they provide the functional programming concepts.

% scala views, broken
% talk about java 8 streams, limitations/bad design? (adv: unboxed?)
% (java: problem type dependent)

\section{Views}
% what operations/methods make sense?
% why scala views broken, which methods useless (never finish)
% problem of inefficiency, why cannot implement certain?

\section{Design}
% hierarchy: interface trait, impl-spec trait, classes
% implicit extension: ext-method, evidence
